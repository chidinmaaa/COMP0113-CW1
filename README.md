Description: This repository contains the code for our collaborative platform - 'Fusion Foundary' for COMP0133 Coursework 1. 

## Overview 
The main aim of this project was to design and develop a collaborative avatar creation platform for a virtual reality (VR) environment. In particular,  an environment which would encourage rich collaboration while supporting the design and customisation of a shared avatar. Consequently, we created 'Fusion Foundry' - a factory-like setting in which players progress through five different rooms - the Fusion Foundry HQ, Body Lab, Style Station, Accessory Studio and Voting Station - completing tasks collaboratively in order to design an avatar, with the end goal of being able to inhibit this newly designed avatar. We implemented a forced collaboration model throughout our project, ensuring that it can only be completed by a minimum of two players.
